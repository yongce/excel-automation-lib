<p> ExcelAutomationLib is a library which is used to read and write MS Excel files. 
    This library works only when MS Excel is already installed on your machine.
<p>Currently, it can only do some simple things. It's still under developing.
<p>You can visit <a href="http://tyc611.cublog.cn">author's blog (Chinese)</a> for giving any suggestions.
