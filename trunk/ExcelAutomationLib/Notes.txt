+ How to pass optional parameters when you call a function in Visual C++
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238981
Some methods have "optional" parameters. In Visual Basic, you can omit them when calling the method. 
However, when calling with Visual C++, you have to pass a special VARIANT whose .vt field has the value VT_ERROR 
and .scode field has the value DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND. That is
      // VARIANT used in place of optional-parameters.
      VARIANT varOpt;
      varOpt.vt = VT_ERROR;
      varOpt.scode = DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND; 
This is what Visual Basic is doing behind-the-scenes.
